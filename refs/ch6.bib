	abstract = {A 760 \${\textbackslash}times\$ 760 \${\textbackslash}times\$ 30 mm\${\textasciicircum}3\$ plastic scintillation detector viewed by photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) from four corners has been developed, and the detector has been tested with cosmic rays and \${\textbackslash}gamma\$ rays. A position-independent effective time T\$\_\{eff\}\$ has been found, indicating this detector can be used as a TOF detector. The hit position can also be reconstructed by the time from four corners. A TOF resolution of 236 ps and a position resolution of 48 mm have been achieved, and the detection efficiency has also been investigated.},

Both scintillators are 0.1 m thick. Measurements of pulse height, timing and position resolution, performed using cosmic rays, are presented and the experimental pulse height response is compared with the predictions of Monte Carlo calculations.},
