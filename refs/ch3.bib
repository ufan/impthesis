	abstract = {The Theory and Practice of Scintillation Counting is a comprehensive account of the theory and practice of scintillation counting. This text covers the study of the scintillation process, which is concerned with the interactions of radiation and matter; the design of the scintillation counter; and the wide range of applications of scintillation counters in pure and applied science. The book is easy to read despite the complex nature of the subject it attempts to discuss. It is organized such that the first five chapters illustrate the fundamental concepts of scintillation counting. Chapters 6 to 10 detail the properties and applications of organic scintillators, while the next four chapters discuss inorganic scintillators. The last two chapters provide a review of some outstanding problems and a postscript. Nuclear physicists, radiation technologists, and postgraduate students of nuclear physics will find the book a good reference material.},

	abstract = {The relationship between the specific luminescencedS/dx of organic scintillators and characteristic quantities of the ionizing particle is investigated. Considering the existence of the two scintillation components and the effect of δ rays, it is shown that dS/dx depends on the specific energy lossdE/dx and on the charge number z of the incident particle: For a given differential energy loss, the ion having the greatest charge number gives rise to the highest light output; for a given particle with increasing dE/dx, the specific luminescence goes through a maximum. The theoretical conclusions are in agreement with experimental results obtained using α particles of 1 to 8 MeV, 3He ions in the energy range 1–3 MeV and protons from 0.3 to 3 MeV. An experimental device is described, which allows a direct measurement of the energy loss ΔE of particles passing through a thin organic scintillator, and of a quantity proportional to the number ΔS of emitted photons.},

	abstract = {The response of a NE102 scintillator to He, C, Ne, Si and Ar ions has been studied at incident energies from 120 MeV up to 18 GeV when used as a transmission (ΔE) counter. The energy of the incident beam was changed by inserting an absorber of various thicknesses made of PMMA plates. The primary particles were identified and separated from projectile fragments by using the ΔE–E counter telescope method. A thin NE102 plastic scintillator and a BGO scintillator were used as a ΔE counter and a residual E counter, respectively. The energy of the primary particles was deduced by comparing the depth-dose distribution measured by an ionization chamber to those by a theoretical calculation. The light output of the NE102, dL/dx, was found to be linear to dE/dx in the low-dE/dx region, while gradually being quenched in the high-dE/dx region. This quenching was regarded as being a phenomenon independent of the particle species. The residual particle-species dependency was well indexed as a function of log (AZ2).},
