	abstract = {Heavy ion beams with energy up to 1 AGeV can be provided by HIRFL-CSR in Lanzhou. By using the fragment separator RIBLL2, radioactive ion beams with energies of several hundred AMeV can be produced and transferred to the external target hall for experiments. To measure online γ -rays with energies below 5 MeV (center-of-mass frame), a CsI (Tl) detector array has been designed and a part of it with 768 CsI (Tl) crystals has been constructed. All the crystals with a cross section around 12 × 10 mm2 and a length between 15 and 17 cm have been produced and treated in the Institute of Modern Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. For reading out the scintillation light large area avalanche photodiodes (APDs) have been used. Based on ASIC chips and PXI bus a data acquisition system has also been developed. In the first test with a 60Co source an energy resolution of 7.2\% (FWHM) has been achieved.},

	abstract = {The cross section for one-proton knockout from O14 on a carbon target at 305 MeV/nucleon was measured to be σ−p(O14→N13)=35(5)mb. The one-proton one-neutron (pn) removal cross section σ−p−n(O14→N12)=30(6)mb and two-proton one-neutron (2pn) removal cross section σ−2p−n(O14→C11)=41(6)mb were also obtained. The deduced reduction factor, the ratio of the experimental and theoretical cross sections, is close to unity for one-proton knockout from O14, consistent with the systematics as well as the result obtained at a much lower beam energy. The indirect reaction process, which involves a one-neutron knockout plus proton(s) evaporation mechanism, is expected to contribute much to the pn and 2pn removal.},

Contributions from the inelastic scattering channels to these data are found to be negligibly small with coupled-channel calculations within the angular range covered by this experiment. These data can be well reproduced by optical model calculations with systematic nucleus-nucleus potentials. The reduced total reaction cross sections were compared with other existing data.},

For 6 He case, overall resolution σ E k for the Gaussian part of the detector response and the detection efficiency including solid angle acceptance with regard to the excitation energy E k are obtained by the simulation of two neutrons from 6 He breakup into the neutron wall. The effects of the algorithm on the angular and energy correlations of the fragments are briefly discussed.},
